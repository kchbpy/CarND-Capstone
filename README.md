## Traffic Light detection

We used [Tensorflow Object Detection API](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection).

### Pre-trained model:

We used [pre-trained model](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md) in the repository.

Choose [ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2017_11_17](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco_2017_11_17.tar.gz) for the first step but have not tested other models yet.

### Training

Details of training with traffic light data in simulator is described in the [repo](https://github.com/satoshikumano/traffic-light-detection-fh).

### TODOs

Inference is tested in this [notebook](https://github.com/satoshikumano/traffic-light-detection-fh/blob/master/TrafficLightDetection-Inference.ipynb).

- Accuracy is not enough.
  - Increase training data/ validation data.
  - Data augmentation.

- Reduce latency of detection.
